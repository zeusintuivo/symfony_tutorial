title: Getting started with Symfony 3: Services and the Container

summary: |
    With [episode 1](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/symfony)
    and [episode 2](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/symfony-doctrine)
    in the books, we've got an app with a rich data model backed
    by Doctrine.

    Now it's time to get serious by mastering *services*. These
    puppies are the backbone of what makes Symfony special & fast.
    It's also the reason that organizing your code into reusable
    chunks is so easy. But beyond that, once you understand how
    services and the service container work, you'll be absolutely
    unstoppable inside of Symfony. Yep, let's do that:

    * Understanding what a service is
    * Listing, fetching and using existing services
    * Creating your own custom services
    * Registering your service
    * Checking out the (mystical) dumped container
    * Configuration Parameters
    * Dependency Injection Tags

    This is the episode where it all starts coming together. Let's go!
